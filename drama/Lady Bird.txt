Most ladybirds have oval, dome-shaped bodies with six short legs. Depending on the species, they can have spots, stripes or no markings at all. Seven-spotted ladybugs are red (or sometimes orange) with three spots on each side and one in the middle. Their head is black with white patches on either side.
